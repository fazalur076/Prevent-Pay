# Prevent-Pay
## Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based system designed to analyze user payment histories and intelligently predict whether the next transaction is likely to be fraudulent. This project leverages historical transaction data and behavior patterns to build a predictive model for real-time fraud detection.

## Key Features:
- Analyzes past user payment behavior
- Predicts the likelihood of fraudulent transactions
- Utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- Ready for integration into real-time payment systems

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Use Cases:
- Financial institutions monitoring payment fraud
- E-commerce platforms detecting suspicious activity
- Real-time fraud alerts and risk assessment

**NOTE: This is my final year project**
